J2EE was more of a standard, like a blueprint
Collection of several interfaces

When you wanted to run your application, you need an application server.

Spring programming model is all about components. These components are like spare parts used in a giant machine. Some of these components are provided by the framework, some by third-party libraries, and some by the developer.

The components I mentioned above are all objects that are used in programming.

The technical term for such an object is a "bean"

When Spring application starts, it holds all such beans in a collection called ApplicationContext.

Spring programming model is to define the beans and use them in a decoupled way in your application.

Decoupling here means, separate the definition from the use

To define the beans you have two ways: @Bean and @Component
To use them in your application, you have the Dependency Injection

This way of separating Bean and usage of bean is called Dependency Inversion or Inversion of Control (DI/IoC)
Dependency Injection is a process in which Spring "provides" you the dependency.

Dependency Inversion is a principle; Dependency Injection is a process.


Bean Scopes: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html

Singleton: for stateless components
Prototype: stateful components
request: stateful, but within the request (user inputs in MVC, etc)
session: stateful components but within the session (shopping cart)
application: configurations across different sessions and requests but within the same Servlet ApplicationContext
websocket: chats, real-time gaming, etc.
